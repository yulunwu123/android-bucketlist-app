Starter Template for the Android UVA Bucket List app
Name: Yulun Wu
Computing ID: yw9pz
Lessons learned: 
 Before starting, I briefly outlined the implementation of the app and had a number of specific operations in mind. However, as I moved on to the actual implementation in Android Studio, I realized that I could encounter more roadblocks and errors than I thought. So it's never too early to start on something since the unexpected can happen at any time. I should always set more than plenty of time to work on a project whose base language/framework that I am not familiar with. Also, I learned that it is a lot more helpful to search for specific problems instead of a more general idea, because there can be various different implementations for a general idea that might actually have conflicts with each other. The searching process will better prepare me for professional development work too since I'll have experience solving real problems through coding.
